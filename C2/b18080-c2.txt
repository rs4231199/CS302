No need to forget completely all you know about programming languages. Some of the feature are used in all programming languages like variables, namespaces, data-types, iterations, etc. But One main difference is immutablity of varibales, what once defined can not be modified. Now the problem is different copies of same data. Persistent data structures are used to solve the this problem. It stores the data in tree like structure to efficiently create copy of data. Funtion used in Funtional Programming are similar in functionality to mathematical functions. Closure use "atom" as a bridge between clean functional world and ugly real world. 'Atom' also manages update collisions itself, which makes the code cleaner. Agents are also used in closure.
Only magic happens when we use threads. Then the speaker tell something about pedestal, a closure library containing 18706 lines.
